Scanners are used by compilers to detect every single character of a file and place each word into a proper classification.

For example, a scanner can be used to detect the keywords of a programming language, such as the keywords 'while', 'if', and 'else'. This specific functionality of a Scanner is called the Recognizer

In this toy project, I will be implementing a recognizer to accept a six-character identifier consisting of an alphabetic character followed by zero to five alphanumeric characters.

## FINITE AUTOMATON ##
A finite automaton (FA) is a way to describe the constraints of your recognizer.
