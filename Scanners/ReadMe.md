Scanners are used by compilers to detect every single character of a file and place each word into a proper classification.

For example, a scanner can be used to detect the keywords of a programming language, such as 'while', 'if', and 'else'.

In this toy project, I will be implementing a scanner to accept a six-character identifier consisting of an alphabetic character followed by zero to five alphanumeric characters.
